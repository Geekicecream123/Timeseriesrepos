# Time_Series_and_Sequence_with_TensorFlow

### Inspiration
This repo is inspired by the content used for my preparation of the TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate, where I have stored some notebooks to refer to when needed, 
and to help other developers find a quick go to solutions to some generic coding challenges.

I have also elaborated a benchmarking notebook for the used techniques that I went through the previous notebooks, 
and it can be used to get a quick working models with their respective accuracy where the results depends on the input.
